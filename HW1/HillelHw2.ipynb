publicity print position with the American Red Cross Tri State Regional Blood Services I continued with regional con MunchCon and there met folk from Marvel I pursued and caught a position with their promotion department in November concentrating on specialty medium and convention then moved over to Editorial in As an editor I spearheaded a revamp of the behind the scene magazine Marvel Age then launched a series of tight focus slightly upscale Collectors Preview special two of which are still to be released in March While at Marvel I looked into a possible job at Random House thus meeting Owen Lock Shelly Shapiro and the other folk at Del Rey and even did a bit of freelance editing some of which I m going to have the opportunity to complete on staff We developed a working relationship

publishing book with u for almost five year now Her style is a mix her character driven set ups are reminiscent of McCaffrey in their attention to relationship and real personality and the action filled sometimes graphically described adventure to which she subject her character can really make you wince How could she do that to those likeable people But a her editor say it keep her off the street And keeping Tara off the street mean in no particular order off mountain off water ski out of patrolling police car out of hang glider off rock face et cetera et cetera we could go on This list cover only her Del Rey Ballantine title All are marked either SF or F and series title are abbreviated a follows Tales of the Wolves Wolves WOLFWALKER paperback SF Wolves SHADOW LEADER paperback SF Wolves LIGHTWING paperback SF STORM RUNNER paperback SF Wolves CAT SCRATCH FEVER paperback SF About the Author Friends of Tara K Harper say that she is opinionated blunt far too efficient unexpectedly patient and kind About half her friend think she is a thrill seeker The rest seem to think she alternate between thinking dreaming and working in a passionate frenzy but they like her cooking and even enjoy the music when she stop playing the same piece three day in a row Her husband agrees with her friend on all those point but he married her so he ha to be more politic about it Ms Harper graduated from the University of Oregon then went into high tech where she ha worked for R D test and measurement company ever since Active in community service she teach creative writing for alternative school train youth group in wilderness skill speaks at library and school class and serf on the board of director for a youth treatment center Ms Harper is a member of the Author s Guild A

bee in her ear and deer at her foot she ha been bear bashed too many time to count She paint in watercolor and oil sculpts in stone play violin and piano and composes music She say that someday she want to perform Tchaikovsky s Violin Concerto in D IN DEPTH I ve been trying to get an In Depth on the topic of subsidiary right one of the busiest and murkiest area of publishing for over a year now and I m happy to finally have one thanks to Camilla Sanderson the Ballantine Group s ever efficient sub right associate Here she explains what she doe all day and why Subsidiary right what s that is a question I m often asked As a Subsidiary Rights Associate I endeavor to get Ballantine book published in foreign language in book club edition in large print edition a audio tape a magazine excerpt and in a fun new area that is opening up for sf fantasy book electronic right primarily CD ROM game based on our book Since I m an Australian citizen and speak Japanese I enjoy the global element of my job It give me a thrill to know that I m helping Katherine Kurtz reach a Japanese audience but it also fun convincing an American audio publisher to buy audio right from u and make tape of Terry Brooks Magic Kingdom of Landover series We hope David Eddings and Stephen Donaldson will appear on audio too There are two and a half people in our department the director my bos is one I m another and the half is another woman who work with u two and a half day a week We try to sell all the right we control to all the book the Ballantine Group publishes This is more than enough to keep u crazed Besides foreign book club large print audio magazine and electronic right some other right include abridgment condensation usually sold to Reader s Digest Condensed Books direct mail licensing paperback reprint though we usually publish the paperback ourselves hardcover reprint film TV right though the publisher rarely control these computer software e g for CD ROM game and electronic reference work character licensing the right to license character in our book to toy manufacturer and merchandise right e g calendar greeting card to name a few The publisher doesn t always control all of the right to a book thank god When the decision is made to acquire a book the editor in charge try to negotiate a contract that give Ballantine control of most of the subsidiary right however the agent often keep some right to sell themselves Agents tend to retain TV film right and merchandise right rather than let the publisher control them If the editor is acquiring the book from an author or an agent we are the initial publisher and we call the book an original If the book is bought from an American hardcover publisher for u to publish in paperback we call our edition a reprint and we won t get any subsidiary right to sell just the right to publish the reprint edition So if we receive an offer for a particular right to a certain book say for example that someone want to publish David Edding s Tamuli series in audio format if we do control the right we would sell it to them for an acceptable price otherwise we refer the interested party to the agent or to the original publisher whichever control that particular subsidiary right In addition to licensing selling right we provide a full spectrum of support we supply production material review and cover art to the licensee for the production of their particular type of edition We are also a department of record which mean that we maintain extensive record on the license we make and we must notify many different people in and outside Ballantine about the deal Furthermore we have to keep track of which book we have submitted to book club foreign publisher and magazine for their consideration All of this information must be quickly and easily accessible to ourselves and to the editor so we keep a lot in database However we also have ever expanding file that house the actual contract we make for each deal Thus a typical day may consist of submitting book for consideration to different type of publisher for the sale of various right supplying production support for example sending a reproduction of the jacket art for our edition of a book to a French publisher who will add the title of the book in French researching which right we control to a book we published in creating a seasonal Rights Guide that we distribute to about a thousand foreign and domestic company which tell them what book we will be publishing each season which right we control and who control the rest referring thirty movie call to the hardcover publisher or the agent since we don t control the dramatic right conducting an auction between two large print publisher who want the same book and are bidding against each other to license it from u I love doing these auction talking to scout who are paid by foreign publisher to check out all the book that are being published by the New York publisher and so it go on every day It s certainly enough to keep u amused copyright by Camilla Sanderson Q A Q A question about P C Hodgell Why is it that an author with such a rabid following who also happens to be a good author can t be picked up by a major publishing house A A rabid following or a vocal fan population online doesn t necessarily translate into a large enough readership nation or world wide to support an author s book Every publisher ha different standard for how many copy have to sell of an author s book in order to keep publishing them and these standard aren t set in stone but flexible however if three or four book or even in some case two book are published to minimal and diminishing sale attention chance are good that the publisher won t take a risk on further book At Del Rey we ll break that rule of thumb if we re very enthusiastic about a submitted book and if we can figure out how to convince bookstore to give the author a new chance Otherwise we have to give the spot on our list to a new author or a guaranteed seller Q Last night I purchased a paperback copy of WORLDWAR IN THE BALANCE by Harry Turtledove I had seen the book in hardcover and I wa disappointed that the softcover edition did not have the same cover art I believe that the cover art on the paperback showing Churchill Hitler and two uniformed type looking at some kind of futuristic weapon is vastly inferior to the hardcover illustration two lizard on the back cover on the front a human hand protruding from rubble witha swastika flag in the background What made you go with the new cover design A Although all of u at Del Rey also really preferred the original art by Bob Eggleton we realized with the advice of our sale rep that to use that art on the mass market edition of the novel would actually prevent many potential reader reader who find strange the extreme lack of convention in sf art from picking up buying and reading a book they might otherwise have enjoyed very much Since it s alternate history and since Harry s previous alternate history GUNS OF THE SOUTH sold to Civil War and history buff a well a sf reader we figured there are two market for WORLDWAR Both cover are true to the spirit of the book but the one on the mass market edition will appeal to both audience not just the sf audience At least that s the hope Q Is Michael McCollum still writing science fiction I believe his last work wa THE SAILS OF TAU CETI which came out over two year ago He is among my favorite author I think I have read everything he ha written and hoped he would write another book in the Antares series A We don t have any further book under contract from Mr McCollum at Del Rey I haven t heard of him publishing with another publisher since SAILS either Q Can I expect to see WORLDWAR TILTING THE BALANCE in store in February How many book will be in this series A TILTING THE BALANCE should show up in store during the last day of February Harry Turtledove plan at least four book in the series Q Does Charles Sheffield plan anymore book in The Heritage Universe than the three he ha already written A We don t have a fourth Heritage Universe book under contract nor have I heard of

your traditional bookstore and that s why they re called mass market book We ship new title every month on a rigid schedule much like magazine in fact in many way paperback are produced and sold more like magazine than their cousin hardcover and trade book Book production is one of those invisible profession that your high school guidance counselor never mentioned I didn t for instance pull on my Daddy s coattail one day and ask Can I be a book production director when I grow up Yes you can be anything you want son Honey what have you been feeding this kid What exactly is book production After the editorial staff have their copy edited manuscript ready and the art department ha provided artwork and design for the cover production is what happens to make the physical object the book itself that you buy and read At the Ballantine Group we produce million of these book per year Our work can be divided into two part first making sure editorial and art have given u everything we need to manufacture the book second purchasing the service of vendor compositor color separator printer and binder who actually make the component and book themselves These vendor are located mostly in the midwest We use printer in the Chicago area and Tennessee and our main printing and binding operation are based in Tennessee a is our warehousing facility centrally located for shipping all over the U S A paperback book is actually two element the text and the cover that are made separately and wedded together in the last few second of the binding operation We divide the work on each of these into two area plant and edition Plant sometimes called pre press work is all the material we need to make in order to begin the manufacturing process film text composition printing plate etc Plant material are one time investment and can be re used only if we are lucky enough to reprint the title Edition is the manufacturing process itself press makeready running time on the press and of course the paper on which the book and cover are printed Edition operation must be performed anew each time the book is reprinted Am I keeping you awake Most of my day to day effort focus on the book cover Covers are important to a paperback book publisher because they are the package in which the book is sold a well a a protective covering Also it is the author who creates the book you read but it is the publisher who creates the cover and much energy is focused on creating a cover that will capture the interest of you the reader Paperback book cover since they play such an important role in life of the book are always pushing the technology of printing and decorating paper board to it limit In addition to color printing we also emboss foil stamp print multiple pass on top of foil use various defraction foil die cut and make step back all to make our cover stand out in the store All of these thing are sometimes even done successively to a single cover We also must put a top coating on top of everything to protect it and give a high gloss There are physical and chemical limitation that we must constantly be aware of For instance we like the look of deep sculpted embossing but we must not actually tear the cover board during the embossing process Chemical component of ink varnish foil coating and UV coating must be compatible or we end up with a layer of sticky goo instead of a slick design I spend much of my time troubleshooting In a perfect world everything go according to plan I am constantly amazed that some thing actually do work out this way Usually they don t Plus circumstance are always in flux We may have wanted book printed for a title yesterday but today we want humid condition in Chicago caused printed sheet to dry too slowly a coating supplier decided to improve formulation without telling u stamping dy were accidently crushed Oprah flashed our title and we need book instantly a color separator gave u beautiful proof for our September title but forgot one we think a job look unacceptable and make our supplier run it over but it had to be at the binder yesterday and so on If you are not born slightly paranoid this work will quickly teach you Murphy s Law cast a long shadow over this business My job is to forsee every possible disaster and make sure it can t happen But the job is invisible and you the reader should never be aware that anything else might have arrived on the shelf but a shiny new perfect book copyright by Steve Palmer Q A Q also A Turtledove Turtledove always you keep e mailing u about Turtledove Well there will be four book

David A Gemmell wa born in London England in the summer of Expelled from school at sixteen for organizing a gambling syndicate he became a laborer by day working on building site digging trench and foundation At night his six foot four inch pound frame allowed him to earn extra money a a bouncer working nightclub in Soho Born with a silver tongue Gemmell rarely needed to bounce customer relying on the what the Irish term the gift of the gab to talk his way out of trouble At eighteen this gift led to a job a a trainee journalist and he eventually worked a a freelancer for the London Daily Mail Daily Mirror and Daily Express His first novel LEGEND wa published in and ha remained in print in the U K ever since He became a full time writer in He his wife Valerie and their two child live in Hastings England Del Rey editor Steve W Saffel interviewed Gemmell recently for the DRIN SWS What have been your major influence over the year GEMMELL There have been three basic influence which have shaped the work As a child I read The Lord of the Rings and wrote to Tolkien He sent me a letter which I treasured for year Secondly I became hooked on the work of Louis L Amour I found his storytelling to be compulsive and his characterization especially in the earlier novel wholly compelling He had a knack of introducing a character with say two sentence of description which left you feeling you d known the man all your life A friend of mine call such character men from Rick s pub They walk out of the bar and on to the page arriving complete No real effort is needed by the author to flesh them out L Amour s talent in this area wa majestic The third major influence wa Stan Lee at Marvel Comics I ve never met him or spoken to him but I love that man The growth of Marvel in the sixty wa a revelation Heroes and villain became interchangeable Both set had fault both had heroic quality The effect wa mind blowing SWS How have your influence affected your approach to the craft of fantasy novel and to characterization GEMMELL When I began to write my own story I realized they were being fueled by what I had gained from these three source Tolkien gave me a love of fantasy L Amour taught me that characterization wa vital and Stan Lee made me realize that the line between hero and villain should always be blurred I based all my character on people I have known and I have been lucky in my life to have met a great many interesting people I wa born in West London in a violent area and many of the people I grew up with were criminal Some were merely thief others men of violence I know the breed But whatever else they were also men of contrast Life is never simple We take a young man and train him for war We teach him to kill without mercy When he come home he is a hero But if once home he us the skill he ha been taught he is considered a villain and a danger to society There is a grand nonsense here I once interviewed a man who ran a protection racket I asked him how he justified his occupation He smiled at me and said I m no different to the government son They tell you to give a percentage of your earnings to them otherwise they ll put you in prison What s that if it s not a protection racket A hero in a fantasy novel doe not have to be nice or kind or caring or God forbid politically correct What he need is courage and a willingness to fight evil regardless of the cost to himself His own prejudice are largely irrelevant SWS What are your current project in the various medium GEMMELL Del Rey ha acquired twelve of my book and I am currently continuing the Drenai and Stones of Power series I am also involved in scripting a television drama series based on a thriller I wrote under the name Ross Harding My agent are also negotiating film right for my first novel LEGEND SWS What have you learned about the different medium by virtue of working in more than one GEMMELL Writing for television is a wholly different discipline Ten page of description can be encapsulated in a single scene and twenty line of dialogue can be put over by a good actor virtually with the raising of an eyebrow The other great thing about television work is that it is far more of a team effort Writing novel is a solitary business Television is about creative tension merging together to create a dynamic story It s much more exciting though ultimately le rewarding for the ego SWS Given your diverse background what area do you still want to conquer GEMMELL That is the most difficult question I have always been highly competitive and rarely satisfied with any achievement I am a workaholic who produce around a quarter of a million word a year I don t really have an ultimate goal I just want to be the best I can be On the other side of the coin I received a letter from a reader who told me that after reading one of my story he wa out walking his dog when he saw two men attacking a woman He ran in and fought them off He told me he wa sure he wouldn t have pitched in so readily if he had not just read a story of hero By heaven I thought life can t get much better than that copyright by David Gemmell Q A Q Does Del Rey handle Julian May whose Galactic Milieu Trilogy is first published in hardcover by Knopf only through subsidiary right or do you also have editorial privilege I am curious if the author or author s agent simply delivers and fine tune the manuscript and then the subsidiary right take care themselves or if there is continued involvement after the hardcover release A Actually the Julian May situation is unusual Usually if we publish the mass market edition of a hardcover we do no editing merely buy the right from the hardcover publisher In this case we and Knopf which is another part of Random House Inc decided that the Galactic Milieu Trilogy deserved a wider audience and Knopf should publish the hardcover with u doing the paperback We still do the editing and consult with them on the cover copy etc In general author involvement after the delivery and editing of the manuscript varies Some author are involved in cover copy cover design approval of copyediting etc Others aren t it depends on the author and the contract Subsidiary right are usually the responsibility of the agent or the publisher with the author possibly making suggestion or giving approval Q I have read the three book written by Steve Miller and Sharon Lee and am curious a to whether any more will be forthcoming it ha been some time since the others were written A Ah the eternal Internet Lee Miller question We don t have any more book under contract from them and don t know of any other deal they have with other publisher Their book just couldn t find a market and we couldn t go on publishing them though we thought those three book were wonderful Q When will the third novel in Harry Turtledove s Worldwar series be out A WORLDWAR UPSETTING THE BALANCE will be a February hardcover Q I understand that a sequel to Larry Niven s RINGWORLD and RINGWORLD ENGINEERS is forthcoming in Will this be a novel actually written by Larry Niven a collaboration or in fact a novel anthology written by other author in the Thrilling Universe Created By Larry Niven A THE RINGWORLD THRONE is a totally Larry production with no help from other author not a collaboration a shared world anthology or anything else but a plain old fashioned novel Ellen Key Harris Editor Del Rey Books Director of Online Projects Ballantine Books delrey randomhouse com DEL REY The Del Rey Internet Newsletter is copyright by Del Rey Books

Eddings give u the epochal autobiography of Belgarath himself the original big bad Old Wolf SAMPLE CHAPTER AVAILABLE ONLINE SLOW RIVER by Nicola Griffith Hardcover EKH Every once in a while an author pigeonholed into a genre sf in this case writes a book that burst the genre s boundary and brings his or her work to the attention of a whole new audience dragging the genre along willy nilly That s what Nicola Griffith author of the award winning AMMONITE ha done with SLOW RIVER which ha a deceptively simple set up it s the story of a young woman from a rich powerful corporate dynasty who s separated from everything she think defines her her family her status her money her career her identity itself She ha to start over from scratch on the underside of a near future European city with nothing building a new person from the ground up Few of u ever get that chance once we ve embarked upon our life and the central question of SLOW RIVER is who you are who you become when you have nothing left what core of yourself remains when you strip everything external away and how much control do you have over what crystallizes around it Of course there s a lot of thought provoking skiffy stuff in SLOW RIVER information crime ID implant bioremediation of the environment through genetically tailored bacteria a future Net with it own mechanism and it own scam but SLOW RIVER is more a novel type sf than science fiction form novel And we will no doubt get review of the I can t believe it s from Del Rey type for publishing it though Locus and SF Age have so far loved the book without any such commentary So if you re looking for a book that stand up to mainstream novel like Jane Smiley s A THOUSAND ACRES and Dorothy Allison s BASTARD OUT OF CAROLINA plus ring the literary genre

they ve thought And he ha Deryni friend THE BASTARD PRINCE is a bit more grisly and gruesome than the previous book definitely the darkest book of the series and the royal intrigue and political plotting are even more diabolical than usual SAMPLE CHAPTER AVAILABLE ONLINE THE GAMESTER WARS by William Forstchen Paperback in SHS Bill Forstchen ha long entwined his love of science fiction and his love of history in his writing and the Gamester Wars trilogy is no exception These book were published individually in the late s and early s and have been unavailable for a year or so This three in one edition present all three book in the trilogy together for the first time For fan of military SF or alternate history Forstchen s use of historical character in a far future setting is a recipe for a galaxy spanning tale of war greed and interstellar mayhem We think it s also lot of fun SAMPLE CHAPTER AVAILABLE ONLINE DEL REY DISCOVERY OF THE YEAR GENELLAN PLANETFALL by Scott G Gier Paperback SS This is one of those rare book that I enjoyed reading even the third time around and I found that the character stuck with me way beyond the last reading It s about a crew of a crippled Earth ship forced to evacuate to an alien planet where they then must learn to survive while they wait for rescue On that planet they meet the sentient native low tech winged people and befriend them they also meet the enemy the warlike Kon from the next planet over It s up to one lieutenant to somehow hold together command of her mixed group of spacer marine and civilian and to make some kind of

boggling social speculation it mark the arrival of Nicola Griffith a a new sf star for the s Vonda N McIntyre chime in with A noteworthy first novel A powerful story of connection allegiance and

Scovil Chichak Galen of New York City ha written this month s In Depth which make a persuasive if obviously a little biased argument for acquiring an agent if you are a professional writer or want to become one This isn t really a what I do all day article so here s a little background agent and editor do many of the same thing all day read submission from known and unknown author suggest revision to promising manuscript check sale figure negotiate contract Agents also do a lot of the thing writer do themselves pack up and send off manuscript with hopeful cover letter wait impatiently for a response call up to try to shake a response loose deal with request for change A good agent is more than the person who sends your manuscript to publisher and get it in the door Shawna McCarthy explains why and how Standard disclaimer just in case this is just an article for the DRIN not an endorsement by Del Rey of a particular agent or agency though we do deal with SCG often As always you don t need an agent to submit a manuscript to Del Rey And now for the pitch HOW TO MAKE MONEY STUFFING ENVELOPES or What doe a literary agent do A literary agent is sort of like a housekeeper until you really need one you can t figure out why anyone else might have one After all what do they do for you that you can t do for yourself if you just do a little extra work And look at all the money you ll save True enough sure you can negotiate your own contract just like you can clean your own kitchen But a professional housekeeper will know that if you mix bleach with Ajax you ll create deadly chlorine gas and a professional iterary agent will know that if you allow the publisher to keep clause sub b sub you might a well go into your kitchen and create some deadly chlorine gas But negoiating contract is only a tiny bit of what an agent doe Long before the negotiating come into play the good agent ha talked with you about your work your feeling and your future He or she ha asked you what you want to write what you will write and where you want to be in ten year A good agent ha looked at your work and determined whether Editor Jones at Mega House would like it more than her sworn enemy Editor Smith also at Mega House He or she ha called everyone at every publishing house who might be interested in your work and excitedly told them about the terrific new novel that is coming their way And once the submission ha gone out your professional literary agent is still on the job relentlessly nagging each and every editor on the list until they ve responded to your book Under the best of circumstance all of them will love it and wave large sum of money in the air allowing your agent to select the best possible deal for you out of many Under really pretty good circumstance two or three will make offer and your agent will play them off against each other until the best possible deal is made Under normal circumstance everyone but one will turn it down at which point the ability to get rid of clause sub b sub becomes really essential If you re like most writer especially new one you ll sign just about anything to get your book published Your agent is there to keep you from signing something truly unpleasant He or she know that the offer isn t going to go away if you haggle some Much like at a flea market a certain amount of negotiating is expected and if it s not forthcoming the writer might a well pin a big Kick Me sign to his or her back And your agent is here to tell you that a writer wearing a Kick Me sign will get kicked But good But there s a level beyond this on which the agent author relationship really function underneath the wheeling and dealing there need to be a fundamental level of trust and respect between agent and client After all in a very real sense we represent you We stand in your stead in the publishing world and a writer who doe not trust his or her agent is like a spouse who doesn t trust his or her mate always looking for the Big Clue that will once and for all prove betrayal The agent author relationship can not function under that sort of cloud and your writing career will suffer a a result of it Thus it often happens that a writer will go through four or five different agent before finding one where the relationship just click This is a fact of life and the agent who take a client s departure personally is in for a very unappy career path Unless of course said author ha taken with him your bank account your significant other and your cat So What do I do for a living Well I m a stern principal an understanding friend a rigid taskmaster a savvy financial advisor an eagle eyed contract reader a hard nosed negotiator a therapist a marital advisor a weatherman even though you don t need one to know which way the wind blow a psychic and an editor But I m a lousy housekeeper copyright by Shawna McCarthy Scovil Chichak Galen Literary Agency Inc Q A Q A in one We ve been getting a lot of request for information on Robotech lately In brief yes all Robotech Sentinels book are still in print along with the various three in one volume sorry we don t know anything about the Robotech

nonfiction title from the controversial ABDUCTION HUMAN ENCOUNTERS WITH ALIENS to Douglas Rushkoff s MEDIA VIRUS and the Ballantine Lesbian Mystery Tour He is also the publicist for the current Del Rey hardcover SLOW RIVER by Nicola Griffith In addition he often read and ass gay themed book or proposal for the Ballantine editor For this month s DRIN he tell u about how a publicist s job fit into the publication process My job is to serve a a kind of gateway between our book and the outside world Everyday you might read book review in newspaper and magazine watch an author being interviewed on The Today Show or Oprah see author a expert in the op ed page or in a news report and maybe even anticipate a reading signing by your favorite author at the neighborhood bookstore or a conference All of these thing are easy to take for granted because they are so evident But in truth behind each appearance review or sound bite there is a publicist working like mad for the reader s attention Publicity can be a grueling affair of long day endless phone call author hand holding meticulous itinerary and damage control but there s an air of excitement too an almost discernible buzz emanating from every publicity department When I first considered publishing a a career the only thing I imagined doing wa what I now know of a the editorial process reading copy editing etc Luckily for me I went to a two day seminar offered at my university where alumnus from the publishing world came to speak about their field and there I wa first smitten by the allure of publicity Publicists can tell great story Believe me the behind the scene is always more interesting than what the public see Publicists have to be outgoing engaging and know how to be charming even when everything is happening at once Most of my work begin after a book is written If it s an original work rather than a reprint we get galley or advance reader s copy to send to the medium and reviewer a both a preview and an attempt to meet the long lead time for most publication A finished book is available to u only very shortly before it available to the public Even before publication I become a spokesperson or cheerleader for a title reading the book meeting with the author and establishing a working relationship collecting editorial summary Then I get busy writing a press release that capture the essence and merit of the book in a concise introductory manner for the over flooded medium We send the release off with a prayer and a lot of follow ups Now the process ha just begun It is important to distinguish between two type of book tour and non tour title Tour book are those whose author we send on the road Being on tour give an author the chance to reach new audience and local medium outlet that would be impossible to reach otherwise A tour can be a weekend in the author s hometown and a neighboring city or an insane twenty city plus East and West Coast blitz These decision are made based on many factor an author s availability our expectation bookstore request for an author s appearance market factor are we reaching the book s audience and our own budget restraint Tours are expensive affair of cross country flying and nice hotel but they re hardly a holiday ask any exhausted author who ha been shuttled back and forth between TV and radio station trying to find time for dinner before the next bookstore reading My part of the tour involves reaching the medium in each city I create a press kit full of vital information an author bio a press release tour date press clipping and the ever important pitch letter Few writer get in on their name alone a book ha to be presented a newsworthy or of interest to the venue s audience After a mass mailing to selected medium and a little wait for the postal system we begin the essential ploy of pitching Pitching can only be described a a roller coaster ride it high and low make for a bumpy time We start by printing out call sheet detailed summary of where we mailed our press kit These give some clue a to who might consider using our book but they ultimately just tell u who to call to get a direct response Pitching is where we get savvy because getting a producer s ear is a privilege and we must win him or her over quickly A producer s response can be a simple no the teasing I m not sure if that idea would work Any other approach or the back to base one Who When an appearance is agreed upon I am the one who coordinate all the who what when and where and relay everything to the author When problem arise later it is my job to fix them Publicists rarely travel with an author unless the author is in New York Otherwise we have medium escort who specialize in taking author to all their appointment in a given city But in New York I will go with author to their taping of The Ricki Lake Show or attend their book signing Since a lot of the national medium stem from New York I get to see a lot of fascinating outlet An example of a non tour book that I m working on now is Nicola Griffith s SLOW RIVER an August Del Rey hardcover I first read the novel when it wa still only a manuscript and instantly wanted to work with it and Nicola Nicola s situation is a bit more complicated than most author because she life with multiple sclerosis and thus is unable to endure the physical strain of a tour Nevertheless we wanted to reach a many people a possible so we decided to concentrate on getting print coverage both review and interview and setting up interview by phone SLOW RIVER is blessed with an especially striking cover that I thought would make a perfect recurring image to entrance reviewer With this in mind I purchased unique folder to paste the cover art onto and created an early word press kit to help showcase SLOW RIVER a a hot up and coming title I mailed these kit with an advance reader s copy to various science fiction lesbian and gay and feminist publication I also did an unusual press release wherein I had the cover art minus text printed a a full page haunting watermark behind the standard style press release The finished effect add an extra sense of depth to the release and hopefully increased notice I also wrote letter to the book reviewer making them aware of SLOW RIVER and anticipating their review Right now Nicola and I are busy collecting the fruit of our work the quote In the near future I ll have enough critical praise to merit a new mailing I also have the finished book now and I ll work with the theory that if X and Y sang the book s praise shouldn t Z take another peek and not miss out on a great book that reader viewer or listener will want to know about Critical blackmail All of this is only the peak of the publicity iceberg Part of what make the job enticing is it unpredictable nature a quiet day can turn instantly frantic with only one phone call I never know who I ll be meeting or talking to next A publicist s Rolodex becomes both a lifeline and a treasure chest To make life even more challenging a publicist is usually working on several book at one time and backlist author call from time to time a well There are many stage to a book s publicity and in truth it never really end The good news is that there are unlimited possibility out there and they are all undoubtedly just a phone call away copyright by Patrick Price Q A Q Whatever happened to Lyndon Hardy and Robert Don Hughes I liked both author have they stopped publishing A Nice to hear from someone else who miss Lyndon Hardy s unique approach to fantasy but Dr Hardy bowed out of the publishing racket after RIDDLE OF THE SEVEN REALMS I think he had plenty of other interesting and rewarding thing to do with his time Robert Don Hughes wa away for awhile

publishing John Brunner since it founding in the late s and we are saddened by his passing last week at WorldCon in Glasgow I took over editing Brunner in the late s having loved his book for year John wa an incredibly talented writer and an exacting author He wrote science fiction in a classic style His view of the future wa not a rosy one his story often foretold the danger of the short sighted us to which technology is put sounding a warning to u all that while technology can enhance human life in wonderful way there is another darker side to technology and a price to be paid for technological advancement In recent year John had often told me that he found it difficult to write story set out in the wide reach of the galaxy because he couldn t see how humanity could ever get there But earlier this summer I had lunch with John and his wife in New York and John seemed slightly more hopeful than he had been before a we tossed around idea for a new Brunner epic It is a shame that we ll now never learn what wonderful new world John might have imagined or have the pleasure of reading about them in John s unique prose Stephen Sterns LATEST EXCERPTS ONLINE Sample chapter of

author of many fantasy novel for Del Rey and Ace including our A Wizard in Rhyme series and the Star Troupers series Though his book are often light in tone the issue that underpin them are more weighty than you might guess Here Stasheff tell u about the genesis of his current series The Star Stone and it mythology In the mid Eighties Tolkien s Silmarillion wa published I wa dazzled by it scope it wa a saga containing outline for a hundred book and staggered to discover that the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy wa only a page and a half toward the end of the book I wa so excited by it that I sat down and wrote an outline for a heroic fantasy Then I sat back looked at it and said There s a story that came before that I decided that I wanted to start writing at the beginning of the series instead of building the last book first and following it with prequels So I sat down and wrote out the outline for that story then sat back looked at it and said There s a story that came before that So I sat down and wrote the outline and Well I ended up with a story about a stone age hero dealing with the building of the first city I decided that wa going back far enough But when Lester del Rey didn t buy that first outline I put the project aside for a while about fifteen year When I finally sent a second outline to Del Rey they decided it might sell So I began The Star Stone Of course I d been thinking the whole series over all that time and working out the detail I followed Tolkien s example working out my own mythology then setting the story within the conflict it contained I already had decided along with many other scholar and author that people need a mythology a a foundation for living and that Christianity doesn t seem to provide a broad enough sweep with the decline of belief in the saint there aren t enough archetype interacting to form myth that cover all the major aspect of today s life As a result Hollywood is busily grinding out variation on the old pagan archetype for u but none of them last long enough to give u a real template for living a full and happy life Therefore I set out to make up a mythology that wa compatible with Christianity centering around the Ulin an elder race of magical giant whom humankind think of a god The Ulin who try to protect human being is Lomallin the Green One aided by the goddess Rahani Against them is Ulahane the Scarlet One determined to rid the earth of the vermin called humanity Against the background of that mythology I showed how an ordinary man could be caught up in this battle of god eventually transcending the limit of his mortality to become a timeless hero almost a demigod The book begin with the sentence Ohaern wa only a man then but that wa then Right there we know we re going to be watching a man becoming something more than human and he doe avenging his wife s death by rescuing the sage who could have saved her life even though he wa imprisoned in Byleo the fortress of the worshipper of the evil god Ulahane the Scarlet One In retaliation Ulahane sends a barbarian horde to wipe out Ohaern s village As a result Ohaern set the goal of his revenge a the slaying of the Scarlet One himself With the help of Rahani the goddess who love humankind and is still determined to save it Ohaern weld together an alliance of human being from the end of the earth half human monster and elementals and attack Ulahane s stronghold The book is about identity a all my book are in one way or another but also about love healing grief death and rebirth and the rebirth of hope and idealism These are I think idea that we need to reaffirm today our age need to regain our parent belief that human being can be good and can become good again even if they have been corrupted I identified the evil god with scarlet the color of blood and the good god with green the color of life because I suspect that the racism that still plague America ha it root in the ancient Zoroastrian mythology of a good god of light endlessly pitted against an evil god of darkness Many recent fantasy have tried to avoid Christianity but have kept the polarity of good light and evil darkness If my new dichotomy catch on maybe we can begin to escape that bias that I think still underlies the way we look at the world and each other If we can we ll begin to form a new concept of our own identity and of our neighbor a always the central point that I believe determines all else about ourselves and our world copyright by Christopher Stasheff Q A Q I just finished reading BELGARATH THE SORCERER and have read all of Eddings work some multiple time and am wondering if this concludes the Belgariad Malloreon series or if there will be more A Stay tuned for POLGARA THE SORCERESS you didn t think Pol would let the Old Wolf have the last word did you When that s published likely sometime in the entire book series will be complete Q I have been a fan of Katherine Kurtz s Deryni novel since the

t think she can have it in to Del Rey before spring though so publication is planned for sometime in Q I wa wondering if there will be any further addition to the Robotech line of novel A We have at least one more Robotech novel scheduled it s BEFORE THE INVID STORM This adventure is actually set between novel and and fill in the gap after the point at which the Master s ship fell to Earth on Monument City and before the Invid arrived The central figure in this novel are Dana Sterling and Col Wolf who return from Tirol with a warship that everyone want each with their own agenda in mind

Del Rey is REDMAGIC Among his other novel GREENMAGIC GRYPHON EYAS and the Chronoplane Wars series THE FALL OF THE REPUBLIC ROGUE EMPEROR and THE EMPIRE OF TIME One of the Del Rey author most active on the Internet he make some keen Net derived observation here about sf fantasy reader the current genre market and the quality of recent sf fantasy For many reader of my generation growing up just after World War II science fiction wasn t something we found in our school library still le in the curriculum It wa a misfit genre it baffled most people and it publication in lurid pulp magazine those Art Deco robot those shrieking maiden in bronze brassiere made it distinctly unacceptable to parent and other authority Well we were misfit too usually too few in a given neighborhood to find many kindred soul For u community most often expressed itself in print in the letter column and editorial of the SF magazine There we d find view that echoed or challenged our own a culture that dealt seriously with issue our parent and classmate didn t even recognize And we read about the fortunates in the SF community who could actually meet face to face at convention and club event Far away in Mexico City I read about convention in New York that seemed impossibly glamorous I read about fanzines produced by other SF reader I read the lively opinionated correspondence in magazine like Astounding not yet Analog and dreamed of sending in my own view When I finally did it wa to pan Robert Heinlein s DOUBLE STAR which had just appeared in Astounding a a serial John W Campbell the editor didn t print my letter Those letter and fanzines were a prototype of today s Internet newsgroups steady exchange of opinion news and gossip springing from a shared love of the genre Access to that early community however wa difficult if you didn t actually live in a town holding a convention how could you hope to attend And if you lived in another country altogether you could only eavesdrop So I grew up aware of the SF fan community but not at all part of it I didn t attend a convention until I wa over thirty when I did it wa only to glimpse Ursula Le Guin the guest of honor and then to leave out of sheer shyness That sense of separation ha persisted though I ve attended some very enjoyable convention and met some wonderful people since With the advent of the Internet however a new community ha arisen one which seems to me both more sophisticated and le informed than that of forty year ago For an SF author the presence of so many reader on the Net can be an enormous advantage We have very little sense of our audience without it We get an idea for a book we write it over a period of month or even year we wait still longer for publication and then for royalty statement Some of u may enjoy hundred of letter from fan but many of u don t get more than a letter or two for every copy sold So author don t know our own culture a well a we should We know the book and author who inspired u to try writing our own book are really extended fan letter themselves response to the challenging idea thrown out to u by the like of Heinlein Asimov and Le Guin And we recognize that their novel are a response to the author they read in their youth What we don t know is how our reader respond to our own work And here is where the Internet show u something about our reader Heinlein Asimov Le Guin and other writer who began publishing in the s s and s had few role model within SF They wrote SF but read in many genre and they expected their reader to be widely read a well even if we were kid Consider Arthur C Clarke s AGAINST THE FALL OF NIGHT later revised a THE CITY AND THE STARS It s rich with literary allusion to the Bible to Jonathan Swift and to other classic source His novel CHILDHOOD S END is almost unintelligible without a solid grounding in Christianity and a couple of course in John Milton would help a well Those of u who read these author a child hadn t read Milton of course but when we did we recognized that the escapist novel our parent had fretted over were actually literature The author of that Golden Age were almost too successful They created genre and subgenres so popular that many reader like me sought to imitate them without necessarily sharing the literary background that made their book so poweful Some of u got published anyway and attracted reader who then sought to imitate u But they were still farther from the source When I follow the discussion in SF newsgroups I see the result The genre is over a century old if we date it from Jules Verne and H G Wells But for many younger reader Clarke is only the author of the Rama series and of A SPACE ODYSSEY Other postwar writer like Philip K Dick are of interest only to expert or Blade Runner fan So discussion tend to focus on very current author or on a handful of the old master Heinlein s STARSHIP TROOPERS still provokes lively debate and who ever talk about book from the mainstream bestseller list of The commentary however reflects the change in the genre The impression I gain from many posting on the Net is that a generation gap ha developed within the SF fantasy community Older reader and writer have a pretty good perspective on the development of the genre and they can judge new work in the light of what came before it Younger reader lacking this perspective are missing a great deal Just a my generation didn t always get the literary allusion in Arthur C Clarke or J R R Tolkien many of today s young reader are ignorant of even the recent influence on the new book they re reading This is not to condemn young reader least of all for being young but to regret what they re missing A genre creating book like STARSHIP TROOPERS creates an excitement that it imitator lack they are after all imitator lacking the new idea and vision of their founder For my generation SF wa by definition a literature of new idea and vision today it too often resembles a mass production industry for a readership that want familiar material not something new and surprising Discussions of SF on the Net therefore resemble debate on the comparative merit of Pizza Hut versus Boston Pizza without reference to Italian cuisine If this discovery through the Net hasn t been entirely welcome it is still useful information As a teacher I have to determine my student area of ignorance before I can deal with them As a writer I need to know what my reader know and to work from there Every novel is a kind of collaboration between writer and reader an interactive education for both Heinlein to name just one of my literary mentor taught me a great deal his greatest lesson I think wa that the student eventually must revolt from the mentor rather than slavishly imitate Out of the growing community on the Net new genre will arise a the reader of SF and fantasy test their response against those of others Some of the genre creating book will generate only a host of clone but an increasingly sophisticated SF fantasy community will prefer new vision As a novelist I will be truly happy if my reader say Great But I can top that and then do so with book that in turn inspire still newer rebellion copyright by Crawford Kilian ckilian hubcap mlnet com Q A Q I read your submission guideline on the Web but no mention wa made on how to submit a Star Wars novelization

to the unusual duo of Flinx and his companion the flying snake Pip Since that auspicious beginning Alan ha gone on to write further adventure with these two character a well a a host of stand alone novel set in the same universe One of the most fascinating world he s created is the jungle covered planet of Midworld In this month s In Depth Alan talk about his love of travel the genesis of Midworld and the connection between that wonderful planet and his latest Flinx and Pip adventure MID FLINX I ve always loved the empty place and I m spending a good part of my life trying to visit a many of them a I can For example in two day I m off to Papua New Guinea That s one of the place I can visit I ve dived with great white shark and ridden whale shark driven solo across the Namib desert explored the outer reach of northwest Australia camped out in the Manu of southeastern Peru and so on But doggone it there are so many more unexplored place I d like to see Fortunately I can conjure them up whenever I want because they happen to exist primarily in the recess and byway of my mind I love to travel and I love to tell story and I ve been combining the two for nearly a quarter of a century One of the first place I always wanted to go wa a rainforest But a I had no money and no time instead of journeying there I had to invent one I could visit via my imagination And since there are few budget constraint on the imagination I figured that a long a I wa imagining I might a well conjure up a world that wa all rainforest That wa MIDWORLD which came about before I ever had the opportunity to travel outside the U S and before zoo and aquarium started building their own rainforest first door on your left no waiting no mosquito Since when MIDWORLD wa written I ve been fortunate enough to marvel and sweat at the real thing in South America in Southeast Asia in Australia even in Hawaii Actual rainforest turned out to be much a I d imagined them only moreso Yet depending on location there were pronounced difference For example in northeast Australia the bug are relatively benign whereas in the Peruvian Amazon they will suck you dry While traversing the Upper Madre de Dios and the Manu river I expected to be bitten I did not expect to be bitten through two shirt one long sleeved or through denim jean For these hungry arthropod DEET is a pre supper cocktail As for citronella repellent room scent would have been a effective When I returned home I most nearly resembled a fugitive from a leper colony Nature can be more aggressive than you ever imagined She can also be more entertaining and I learned lesson in my travel that I wanted to share I d written about a giant otter long before I ever saw one but the reality turned out to be more endearing than my imagination Fast forward Years slip slide away View montage of author dutifully scribing Readers speak fondly of MIDWORLD and inquire about a sequel It s always flattering for a writer to be asked for a sequel because it say that the original work is still well remembered But sequel are difficult and I frankly never thought of doing one to MIDWORLD Readers also kept asking about the further adventure of Flinx and Pip I d left that slightly disreputable pair to go their own way for a while and reckoned it wa getting near time to see what they were up to Trouble wa I couldn t think that they were up to anything Which is when a sometime happens the Prince of Serendip ups and boot el mio in the butt and venture his own suggestion Which is how the requested sequel to not one book but several came about and how it continues the tale not only of Midworld and of Flinx and Pip but of the eventual resolution of the entire interconnected Commonwealth sequence None of which I had in any way in mind when I wrote the very first book of the series THE TAR AIYM KRANG back in The Commonwealth wa not planned and neatly laid out from the beginning There never wa a Heinleineseque Future History chart The series ha grown along with me and frequently in spite of me People keep asking about the darndest thing bit and piece of story I ve completely forgotten about or put aside and guilt ridden soul that I am I feel compelled to answer their question Besides it s fun Just don t ask Flinx or Pip or Ethan Fortune or Skua September or the whale or Truzenzuzex or Maxim Malaika or the AAnn or anyone else what s it all about or where it s all going because they don t know and neither do I At least not quite yet It s all going somewhere though That much I m sure of I suspect the Ulru

Ballantine Publishing Group Diversions cycling cybersurfing screenwriting Authors with the most space on my bookshelf Philip K Dick Kurt Vonnegut Jr Book I recommend most A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES by John Kennedy Toole Net address gbick randomhouse com The Pavlovian response to the word publishing is editor At least that s the first thing that popped into my head when I heard the publishing bell ring That must have been sometime between reading HAVE SPACESUIT WILL TRAVEL by Robert Heinlein and declaring Psychology a my college major The thought of sitting in a big comfy chair with a banker s lamp by my side a pen cup filled with red felt tip and a stack of unsolicited manuscript seemed like the dream career Until I actually went publishing job hunting and all sort of bell went off You re probably wondering what ID sale are And what it is I do to manage them nationally And why I m not an editor Well first thing first ID is an acronym for Independent Distributors There are roughly Independent Distributors in the US and Canada selling and distributing book and magazine and POGs trading card sunglass etc to a variety of retail outlet in their service area airport rail station military base school supermarket drugstore and national chain store like Walmart Target K mart Walgreens Albertson s Safeway and so on basically any non traditional book outlet though many wholesaler own and service bookstore and newsstand A service area can range from a few square mile to hundred of square mile but the ID s function is essentially the same and can be broken down to three basic element Having intimate knowledge of the demographic of the service area so that product can be matched to consumer demand Example Carry a higher proportion of science fiction and fantasy title if the wholesaler service military base high sf fantasy readership in our armed force Ability to deliver and merchandise dated material especially book and magazine to a huge number of retailer within a tiny window of time typically within one to three working day Example The new edition of TV Guide is lovingly merchandised in every grocery check out lane each and every week Performing warehousing function so that retailer can instantly capitalize on hot mass medium event movie tie in book celebrity tell alls etc Retailers can also rely on on demand fulfillment of order and reorder An empty rack pocket is a lost sale Example Safeway can call their local wholesaler to instantly replenish movie tie in copy of say HOW TO MAKE AN AMERICAN QUILT rather than ordering directly but not quite a quickly from u And this is just the bare bone of what wholesaler do They also solicit and penetrate new market do chain marketing place ad host author function and so on Now that you have an idea of what wholesaler are let me discus briefly what it is I do instead of edit We have twenty five sale representative in the US eight rep in Canada and one telemarketing rep calling on all wholesaler The rep in turn report to six regional sale manager who report to my superior commanding officer the Director of ID Sales He quip that I do all the work and let me tell you he is a very smart cookie There are three very basic stage to publishing for profit Acquire book Reps sell them to account both wholesaler and bookstore Consumers respond i e buy at the retail level The major focus of my position fall in between and To borrow an Orwellian term I could be called the Minister of Information for it is my responsibility to distill the prodigious amount of information gleaned in meeting both virtual and physical about our upcoming book into easy to digest sale bit that the rep can use most effectively Since the Ballantine Publishing Group publishes roughly forty title each and every month and each rep ha ten to fifteen account to call on you can see how crucial time management becomes Not only do I distill but I also devise and effect sale strategy and marketing tactic aimed at increasing volume efficiency and market share These element also serve to affect above To spread the information and inspiration to the field force I use various medium Lotus Notes Powerpoint the Web good old fashioned conversation and face to face confab How doe that adage go You can t fax a handshake Learning from mistake and success is the final component in this process and the most valuable Since we sell each month s list of book five month in advance we re selling March new release in November we won t know the result of the best laid plan until a year later Building a database of what work and what doesn t is crucial to maintaining major player status in an extremely competitive marketplace Lastly I work with every department from art to warehousing wish there wa a department that began with Z to keep the whole machine humming So why am I not an editor Well when I first started hunting for publishing gig I answered an ad at Warner Books for an editorial position I wa asked to take a typing test which I failed miserably Thought I d be reading other people s typing Anything available that doesn t require a typing test I asked Much riffling through paper We do have a sale position open Interested Sales hmm The base salary is also more Ding ding That wa eight year ago and I m still amazed that they actually pay me to do this I m also still amazed at how few editor there really are in publishing Maybe it s that darn typing test copyright by George Bick gbick randomhouse com Q A Q Are David and Leigh Eddings going to come out with any additional book like BELGARATH THE

KING OF SHANNARA a prequel Here Mr Brooks tell u why he wrote another book in the series why it s a prequel and not a sequel and what he might be working on next ORIGINS OF SHANNARA I wasn t going to write FIRST KING OF SHANNARA Really I wasn t I wa going to begin work on a new fantasy series one that I had been mulling over for almost five year one that take place in this world in present time With the completion of WITCHES BREW in the Magic Kingdom series I wa more than ready to tackle this newest project But then my editor intervened a editor sometimes will albeit in a kindly way suggesting that perhaps I should do another Shannara book first What Another Shannara book Already I wa flummoxed Besides I didn t have another Shannara book to give him The story after THE TALISMANS OF SHANNARA requires a two book set and I definitely wasn t about to do two Then I remembered my often considered but still unrealized plan for a prequel to the series It wa you the reader who kept asking for it Tell u about the time before coming of the Ohmsfords Where were Allanon s origin How did he become a Druid How wa the Sword of Shannara forged How were the Druids destroyed at Paranor so that Bremen became the last Where did Jerle Shannara come from and how did he end up with the Sword Those were the kind of question I would receive on a regular basis But I steadfastly refused to answer them saying that it wa better if the reader imagined it for themselves thinking slyly that I would someday write that story myself Well here wa my chance But this seemed to me a hard story to write The ending wa already known to every reader of the series So how could I make it exciting and suspenseful I didn t want to give a bland recitation of the event surrounding the battle between the rebel Druid Brona and Jerle Shannara and let it go at that Then after some thought and some casting about for a solid plotline I came up with what I thought wa a good story There were some new character including the Borderman Kinson Ravenlock the Druids Risoa and Tay Trefendwyd the apprentice Druid Mareth and Jerle Shannara s great love Prela Starle There were old friend like the once Druid Cogline There were more than a few new tale to be told about some familiar people and a few revelation about how thing came to be To my surprise the outline came together in about three week I knew it wa going to be a big book because the story wa sprawling and covered a large period of time Don t worry said my editor Don t worry said my wife I immediately began to worry But the ease with which the story unfolded once I began to write it wa a pleasant surprise Even Keke the cat got in on the action Early in the writing of the book I left the computer on and walked downstairs for a short break While I wa gone Keke must have walked across the keyboard because when I came back the sentence I had left unfinished now read There is time yet before it reach u Bremen whispered I think we should aaaaeeaeaeaeeeeiiiiii Of course maybe it wasn t the cat Maybe it wa the thing that live under the house Maybe they re getting impatient The book I put off doing after all is about them copyright by Terry Brooks IN DEPTH II Didn t like the previous In Depth perchance In honor of the DRIN s third anniversary this month we have two Bill Smith is the Star Wars roleplaying game line editor for West End Games Since joining West End in he ha edited or written over Star Wars game book and he ha entirely too much fun doing his job He life in Northeastern Pennsylvania with Amy his understanding girlfriend and a mountain of Star Wars stuff Here he tell u a little about his latest project George Lucas captured my imagination when an Imperial Star Destroyer first rumbled overhead What can I say I wa only a kid Now that I m twenty seven an adult by some standard I guess you re expecting me to say I ve outgrown such thing Guess again Star Wars is my favorite fictional playground It ha hero and villain alien and droids and of course starship and vehicle Which brings me to THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO VEHICLES AND VESSELS Soon after getting the chance to write this guide I realized that my biggest challenge would be making a book of technological gadget a much fun a the movie from which they were drawn So I went back to the basic For example the Rebel Alliance s X wing fighter ha always fascinated me From the first time I saw this sleek ship I wanted to know more Who built the X wing How did the Rebels get them How do they stack up against ship like Y wing and TIE fighter I didn t much care about the theoretical physic of hyperdrives I cared more about understanding Star Wars technology in a practical useful way I wanted to understand this universe and the ship that belonged to it After choosing one hundred vehicle and vessel graphic artist Troy Vigil known for his popular Star Wars Blueprints illustrator Doug Chiang from Industrial Light and Magic and I went to work The resulting guide cover the ship and vehicle from the movie a well a many from the novel comic and role playing and computer game Each ship or vehicle entry includes a technical diagram an illustration and an essay discussing it history us and capability Ever wonder why Darth Vader s TIE fighter is special Or how AT AT walker unload troop Or how the Jawas got their greedy little hand on sandcrawlers The GUIDE answer these question and many others And the GUIDE detail ship you ve never seen on screen You ll learn about the Katana Fleet Dreadnaughts used in Timothy Zahn s three book cycle and the infamous Sun Crusher from Kevin J Anderson s Jedi Academy Trilogy There s even a sneak peek at the upcoming Shadows of the Empire saga We put together THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO VEHICLES AND VESSELS to be your handbook to these wonder of the Star Wars galaxy I hope you enjoy reading it a much a I enjoyed writing it Copyright by Bill Smith Q A Q I am writing to find out about Christopher Stasheff s fantasy series A Wizard in Rhyme I wa wondering if there is another book in the series and what is it called A Mr Stasheff is working on a Wizard in Rhyme book right now In the meantime he s taken a book detour starting a new series called The Star Stone Book One THE SHAMAN is already available in hardcover and Book Two THE SAGE will be out in July Q Will there be any more book by Donald E McQuinn in the WARRIOR WANDERER WITCH series A Currently Mr McQuinn doesn t have any novel planned in the Warrior series but there s always the possibility that he may go back to check on Tate s adventure sometime in the future Don s next book first of a two part series will be a far future military SF novel set in another star system It will be published in early in mass market paperback Q What determines whether a compilation novel two in one or three in one volume get released A A bunch of interrelating factor a new book in a popular series often put u in mind of a two in one or three in one edition of earlier book in the series We republish backlist classic in this combined format called omnibus in the trade to give them another shot at the shelf with an attractive price omnibus edition always cost le than two or three separate book And sometimes an unrelated new book by a popular author or renewed interest in a series is reason enough to publish an omnibus However omnibus edition are expensive to produce especially when like now paper price are very high Therefore the profit margin on them is very low so we can t do them for all our author and series
